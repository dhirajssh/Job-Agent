I did like 125 questions switching between learning concepts and memorizing the top questions on Amazon's frequents. I also really loved the videos provided by NeetCode since it really helps you learn how to explain your solutions.\\n\\n      For behavioral, I did mock interviews with my college career center, did one TopMate interview with an Amazon employee, and watched a lot of GG and Amazon Bound.\\n\\n**The Predicament**\\n\\n      I just started a position with Deutsche Bank. After receiving this offer, I stopped applying, but Amazon reached out way later and it just went well. I feel bad leaving the bank so early, but:\\n\\n- \\n\\n      Growth trajectory & tech stack is  stronger at AMZN\\n\\n- \\n\\n      Pay difference was too big to ignore\\n\\n- \\n\\n      LP culture aligns with how I like to work (bias for action, ownership)\\n\\n- \\n\\n      I want to explore a new location (Seattle)\\n\\n      If anyone is in a similar “late FAANG offer vs. early start at another firm” situation, feel free to ask!\\n\\n**Tips that helped me**\\n\\n1. \\n\\n      Daily LeetCode but review patterns, not just solutions. This made speaking about my process much easier. I swapped between practicing ones I had already done, trying new ones fresh, watching NeetCode explanations, and learning the fundamentals of certain patterns.\\n\\n2. \\n\\n      Mock calls. I used external friends and the career center, but I also just spoke to chatGPT and asked for feedback. That was ultimately the make or break for my answers in the behavioral round.\\n\\n3. \\n\\n      Know your why. Recruiters can tell when you’re genuinely excited about a company versus chasing a brand name.\\n\\n**What’s next**\\n\\n      I move from Raleigh,\\u202fNC to Seattle in two weeks. If anyone has advice on neighborhoods or handling the compressed onboarding window (30 days), I’m all ears.\\n\\n      Thanks to this community for all the advice and motivation over the years. Couldn’t have done it without lurking here nightly.\\n\\n      Read more\\n\\n Share \\n\\n          Share\\n\\n[ \\n\\n flydotio ](/user/flydotio/)\\n\\n•\\n\\nPromoted\\n\\nTry Fly.io for Free\\n\\nLearn More \\n\\n      fly.io\\n\\n            Sort by:\\n\\nBest\\nOpen comment sort options\\n\\nBest\\n\\nTop\\n\\nNew\\n\\nControversial\\n\\nOld\\n\\nQ&A\\n\\n[\\n\\n](/user/HerVengeance/)\\n\\n[\\n      HerVengeance\\n    ](/user/HerVengeance/)\\n\\n•\\n[ 16h ago ](/r/leetcode/comments/1m3iheo/comment/n3x48ij/)\\n\\n      No system design?\\n\\n      Also, did they make you implement quick-select for top k elements question?\\n\\n Reply \\n\\n          reply\\n\\n Share \\n\\n          Share\\n\\n[\\n\\n](/user/csk20000711/)\\n\\n[\\n      csk20000711\\n    ](/user/csk20000711/)\\n\\n•\\n[ 17h ago ](/r/leetcode/comments/1m3iheo/comment/n3wy3bk/)\\n\\n      Hi OP, congratulations and I want ask which team you got hired to?\\n\\n Reply \\n\\n          reply\\n\\n Share \\n\\n          Share\\n\\n[\\n\\n](/user/Brawling-_-Bunny1/)\\n\\n[\\n      Brawling-_-Bunny1\\n    ](/user/Brawling-_-Bunny1/)\\n\\n•\\n[ 17h ago ](/r/leetcode/comments/1m3iheo/comment/n3wyc5y/)\\n\\n      Thanks so much.

It operates 24/7 and costs us to operate, so we charge for access to keep the site running.Can I cancel my subscription anytime?Of course! You can cancel your subscription at any time with no hidden fees or penalties. Once canceled, you’ll still have access until the end of your current billing period.What is the difference between Remote Rocketship and other job boards?Other job boards only have jobs from companies that pay to post. This means that you miss out on jobs from companies that don't want to pay.\\n\\n      On the other hand, Remote Rocketship scrapes the internet for jobs and doesn't accept payments from companies. This means we have thousands of more jobs!How often are new jobs posted?New jobs are constantly being posted. We check each company website multiple times a day to ensure we have the most up-to-date job listings.Can I suggest jobs to be added?Yes!

I read every request.Who built Remote Rocketship?Remote Rocketship is a solo project by me, Lior Neu-ner. I built this website for my wife when she was looking for a job!

At Web Canvas, we specialize in designing and building intelligent automation systems that connect your tools, analyze your data, and take action—so your team can focus on higher-value work.We’re not talking about basic task automations or rigid rule-based scripts. We build AI-driven automations powered by large language models (LLMs), API orchestration, and real-time decision making. Whether you want to process incoming emails, generate custom reports, or respond to customer queries with smart logic, we deliver automations that work 24/7 with human-level flexibility.### What We Offer\\n\\n#### AI Workflow Automations\\n\\nAutomate complex multi-step tasks across platforms like Notion, Slack, Google Sheets, HubSpot, Airtable, and more—with AI logic that adapts in real time.#### Email and Inbox Automations\\n\\nSort, respond, escalate, and summarize incoming emails with AI-powered email handlers that reduce inbox fatigue and speed up customer support.#### Report Generation & Data Summaries\\n\\nConnect your databases and CRMs to AI-powered pipelines that create custom reports, charts, and insights—automatically, accurately, and on schedule.#### AI Powered Document Processing\\n\\nExtract meaning, context, and action items from PDFs, spreadsheets, or internal docs using AI with memory, classification, and summarization skills.[Book an Introduction Call](https://getwebcanvas.com/contact)### Why Should I Hire a Pro to Build My AI Automations?\\n\\nAI automation isn’t just “set it and forget it.” Real value comes from strategic planning, seamless tool integration, and airtight logic. When done right, automations save time, improve consistency, and unlock growth. Done wrong, they create confusion or risks.At Web Canvas, you get:- Custom automation design that maps to your business goals\\n- Clean, documented builds with clear logic and fallbacks\\n- Secure API connections and encrypted data handling\\n- Real-time error tracking and support\\n- A partner who understands both AI and operations\\nYou don’t just need an automation—you need a system you can trust.### Our AI Automation Process\\n\\n#### 1. Automation Audit & Discovery\\n\\nWe review your current workflows, tools, and bottlenecks to identify areas where automation could save time and reduce errors.#### 2. Design & System Mapping\\n\\nWe design detailed maps of how your automations will flow—what triggers them, what decisions they make, and what actions they take.#### 3. Build & Integration\\n\\nWe develop the automation logic, connect APIs and tools, and implement the AI layers for context-based decision making and responses.#### 4. Testing & Validation\\n\\nYour automation is tested in a sandbox environment, with error tracking, user feedback, and fallback logic.#### 5. Deployment & Optimization\\n\\nOnce live, we monitor behavior, refine prompts and workflows, and improve system logic based on real-world use.### The Web Canvas Difference\\n\\nMost automation tools require you to duct-tape solutions together. At Web Canvas, we engineer end-to-end AI automations that are secure, robust, and tailored to your exact business logic.You’ll work directly with the automation developer and AI engineer, which means fewer delays, tighter communication, and better results. With over 21 years of experience in tech and digital systems, we build automations that aren’t just functional—they’re foundational.We believe great AI automation should:- Reduce time spent on repetitive tasks\\n- Lower human error and data inconsistencies\\n- Scale without added headcount\\n- Integrate deeply with your current systems\\n- Be traceable, auditable, and secure\\n### Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\n##### Can you automate across all our tools?\\n\\nYes. We work with tools like Notion, Airtable, Zapier, Make, CRMs, databases, spreadsheets, and custom APIs.##### Can I update the automation later?\\n\\nYes! We build in flexibility so your system can evolve with your needs—and we’re here if you want help improving it.##### Do I need technical knowledge to use it?\\n\\nNot at all. We design interfaces and workflows so your team can run things confidently without coding.[Get A Free Consultation](https://getwebcanvas.com/contact)#### Discover\\n\\n[Book a call](/contact)[Blog](/blog)#### Policies\\n\\n[Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)[Accessibility Statement](/accessibility-statement)#### Solutions\\n\\n[Web Design](/web-design-near-me)[App Development](/app-development-2)[Digital Marketing](/digital-marketing-and-seo)[AI Services](/ai-services)#### Primary Areas Served\\n\\nWeb Canvas serves clients worldwide.
