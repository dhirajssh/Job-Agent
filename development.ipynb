And we're creating an ecosystem that pushes the world toward a brighter future. Our purpose may be relatively new, but it’s possible because of years of hard work and the foresight of teams across our business – including everything we’ve done in the tech space.We’re going beyond digital collaboration tools, beyond the flexibility of hybrid working, beyond any model or methodology, to a mindset that truly transforms what we do.## \\n                Curiosity powers. AI enables.\\n\\n                We're re/writing the future of software engineering at UBS.\\n            We’re making bold moves to become an AI-enabled institution where clients, employees, and shareholders benefit from cutting-edge AI technologies.One of our most transformative initiatives is the immediate rollout of AI-augmented development tools for our software engineers. This will redefine how we build and develop software at UBS and enable us to deliver solutions for our businesses, our clients, and our employees in a way that is faster, more innovative, and more scalable than ever before.But it’s more than just tools – it’s a mindset shift.

Are you in?\\n\\n### \\nWhat is the International Graduate Program all about?\\n\\nThe International Graduate Program (IGP) at Infineon gives you full insight into how we come up with innovations. Over the course of 18 months, you have at least three different assignments – one of them abroad. By working in different departments, you can get an idea of what suits you best. The program can be started in different locations. How about Munich, Singapore or Los Angeles? From the beginning, you’ll have a chance to roll up your sleeves and take on challenging tasks. The focus is on developing your skills, which is why a defined roadmap is drawn up at the beginning.\\n\\nYour Browser does not support HTML5 Video tag or the video cannot be played.0:000:00 / 0:41Email LinkWrong email addressPrimary Email Address*Add Another Email AddressWrong email addressFrom*MessageCancelSend Email320x240640x4801280x960Custom SizeGet Embed CodeTo get embed code, copy and paste: Embed Size640x480CancelSelect AllShare LinkTo share this link, copy and paste:CancelSelect All\\n\\nWe are looking for talents in a number of areas.

And we're creating an ecosystem that pushes the world toward a brighter future. Our purpose may be relatively new, but it’s possible because of years of hard work and the foresight of teams across our business – including everything we’ve done in the tech space.We’re going beyond digital collaboration tools, beyond the flexibility of hybrid working, beyond any model or methodology, to a mindset that truly transforms what we do.## \\n                Curiosity powers. AI enables.\\n\\n                We're re/writing the future of software engineering at UBS.\\n            We’re making bold moves to become an AI-enabled institution where clients, employees, and shareholders benefit from cutting-edge AI technologies.One of our most transformative initiatives is the immediate rollout of AI-augmented development tools for our software engineers. This will redefine how we build and develop software at UBS and enable us to deliver solutions for our businesses, our clients, and our employees in a way that is faster, more innovative, and more scalable than ever before.But it’s more than just tools – it’s a mindset shift. We see this as an opportunity to reimagine how we work, empowering our engineering community to move at the pace of AI-driven change.\\xa0Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlaySkip backward 10 secondsSkip forward 10 secondsMuteCurrent Time\\xa00:00/Duration\\xa00:00Loaded: 0%0:00Stream Type\\xa0LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time\\xa0-0:00\\xa01xPlayback Rate- 2x\\n- 1.75x\\n- 1.5x\\n- 1.25x\\n- 1x, selected\\n- 0.75x\\n- 0.5x\\nChapters- Chapters\\nDescriptions- descriptions off, selected\\nCaptions- captions settings, opens captions settings dialog\\n- captions off, selected\\nAudio TrackQuality LevelsPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

engineering, data analysis, machine learning, and building and powering huge data centers, says a recruiting expert.[Daphne Allen](/author/daphne-allen), Editor-in-Chief, Design NewsFebruary 19, 20254 Min ReadSupatman/iStock/Getty Images Plus via Getty ImagesAI developments continue to increase, whether it is Grok 3, [DeepSeek](https://www.designnews.com/electronics/deepseek-splashes-onto-the-tech-market), [The Stargate Project](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/), or any of the numerous niche applications that are emerging. These increasing investments indicate that this field will continue to expand. And that includes ongoing career opportunities.Given all the AI news this year so far, we checked in again with Scott Sargis, founder & president of\\xa0Strategic Search Corporation, who told us in December that AI skills will be in demand and that careers in\\xa0“AI, robotics, and IoT will continue to do very well.”“In general, the outlook for engineers and technical personnel will be even rosier than I thought and shared in your [December 2, 2024, article](https://www.designnews.com/industry/what-s-the-2025-outlook-for-engineering-jobs-),” Sargis tells us. “For example, when World Economic Forum January 2025 panel moderator Borge Brende, president and CEO of WEF, asked about the relationship between the US and China over the next four years, [President Trump responded](https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/remarks-by-president-trump-at-the-world-economic-forum/), ‘I think that we are going to have a very good relationship. All we want is fairness. We just want a level playing field.’ This points to greater US prosperity in general and more engineer career opportunities in specific. Not just the engineering opportunities as part of the more than 100,000 projected jobs from the $500 billion Stargate AI project will create, but also for many other new, ancillary engineering jobs.”Related:[The Evolution of AI Through Key Milestones & Breakthroughs](/artificial-intelligence/from-turing-to-gpt-4-the-evolution-of-ai-through-key-milestones-breakthroughs)Sargis believes these jobs\\xa0will “include AI software engineering positions for those proficient in such programming languages like [Python](https://www.designnews.com/electronics/using-python-to-program-raspberry-pi-5-for-iot-devices-sensors-robotics), [ChatGPT](https://www.designnews.com/artificial-intelligence/putting-chatgpt-4-0-through-its-paces), C++ and Java. However, this will also include a diverse array of other engineering jobs including data analysis, machine learning, plant and project engineers (for construction of the huge data centers), and energy-related engineering positions (especially since these huge AI data centers will require vast amounts of new energy).”It is also important to note that billions of dollars of venture capital are flowing to AI startups, according to [Crunchbase data](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/startups-ai-seed-investors-data-charts-ye-2024/?utm_source=cb_daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=20230703), potentially offering a range of opportunities.## AI newsmakers\\n\\nEven though The Stargate project initially included technology partners Arm, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, and OpenAI, engineers shouldn’t take their eyes off Elon Musk and his technology plans. Musk\\'s xAI just released [Grok 3](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/musks-xai-unveils-grok-3-ai-chatbot-rival-chatgpt-chinas-deepseek-2025-02-18/), for instance.\"As I shared in your December 2, 2024, article, ‘Follow the Musk.’\" Sargis says. \"Musk carries enormous weight in this administration not only for DOGE, which offers continuous improvement and cost cutting, but also with futuristic technical achievements,\" Sargis says.Related:[Stop Scaling Blind: How Engineers Can Prevent DevOps & AI Startups from Burning Cash on Growth](/artificial-intelligence/stop-scaling-blind-how-engineers-can-prevent-devops-ai-startups-from-burning-cash-on-growth)For instance, \"to demonstrate the depth and breadth of how adept the DOGE \\'Wiz Kids\\' are at applying AI to assist with their herculean cost-cutting tasks,\" Sargis points to one DOGE engineer, Luke Farritor, who once used \"auto segmentation algorithms\" to \"[virtually unroll a fragile Herculaneum scroll without physically cracking its carbonized layers](https://www.rdworldonline.com/how-a-doge-engineer-and-former-spacex-intern-used-ai-to-decode-some-of-historys-oldest-sealed-scrolls/),\" according to R&D World.\\xa0Says Sargis: \"Luke’s past accomplishment points to the unique knowledge and applications of AI that Musk’s DOGE team is applying.\"\\xa0## How can you tap into AI for success?\\n\\nSargis advises engineers to “pursue AI prowess in a non-conventional manner. Growing fields such as AI are changing so quickly that formal classes or degrees will often have a one-year lag time for relevancy. This means that by the time the curriculum for the class or degree becomes institutionalized, that class or degree will no longer be as relevant. Instead, engineers should consider joining associations, symposiums, lectures, work groups, and online learning to acquire needed cutting-edge skills, as they will be a more robust way to learn develop AI knowledge.”Sargis also advises job seekers to develop their interviewing skills. He says his recruiting team “regularly complains that young engineers, scientists, and technology professionals lack strong interview skills. That is why my firm developed the \\'Real Benefit Exercise\\' for our engineering candidates. We studied top salespeople to see what they were doing right in closing their deals. Then we isolated those behaviors that were easiest to replicate by our engineers during job interviews. We found that the best ones spoke in terms of benefits to the customer. In this case you should view your interviewer as your customer and what you have to offer is a solution to their needs.

July 15, 2025 — To address a workforce\\xa0shortage of engineers while avoiding industrial disasters caused by human error, AI startup IntuigenceAI announced what it calls a superintelligent AI-based engineer, IntuiAI, designed as a multiplier for human engineers.\\nIntuigenceAI, based out of Berkeley, California, achieved a first-time pass rate of 82% on the standardized NCEES Professional Engineering (PE) exam for both chemical and mechanical engineering, respectively—beating out ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek by more than eight times. IntuigenceAI, which calls its AI agents “Intuigents,” is available at launch as a highly trained chemical or mechanical AI engineer, with several other Intuigents to follow including civil, electrical, industrial and materials engineers. Each Intuigent can work safely alongside human talent to accelerate common industrial workflows.\\nThe company said several Fortune 100 companies are completing successful pilots with the objective of saving millions of dollars by automating tedious workflows across the $3.4 trillion engineering industry. These workflows consume weeks or even months of engineering resources, which IntuigenceAI says can be reduced to days or even minutes, freeing engineers for more complex tasks requiring human intuition.\\n“As someone who has spent decades in process automation, advanced control and optimization, I see IntuigenceAI as the next generation of industrial technology,” said Doug Raven, a former senior engineer from Saudi Aramco’s Corporate Engineering department and recipient of the top Saudi Aramco Excellence Award. “There’s clearly a workforce shortage coming as experienced engineers retire, and this technology represents a powerful solution for knowledge capture and leveraging engineering expertise. IntuigenceAI can help companies capture their unique methodologies and institutional knowledge while enabling engineers to focus on higher value-added work like process innovation, optimization, and complex problem-solving. The vision of multiplying human engineering capabilities is exactly what the industry needs to address both the skills gap and the complexity of today’s multi-million dollar, multi-year projects.”\\n\\nAccording to an analysis by the Coalition to Prevent Chemical Disasters, there is\\xa0a new chemical accident every two days\\xa0in the US. Equipment failure and human error can have catastrophic consequences in industrial environments.\\xa0Infrastructure projects average 28 percent cost overruns\\xa0with 85% exceeding budget, while workers spend 14+ hours weekly just looking for project data.\\n“AI has the potential to save millions of dollars and many lives by addressing a serious skills deficit,” said Moe Tanabian, CEO and founder of IntuigenceAI. “While AI has quickly revolutionized software development, using engineering-purpose AI for industrial workflows and data analysis has not been feasible until now.” Tanabian was formerly Global Vice President and executive product leader at Microsoft, Amazon and Samsung. “IntuigenceAI frees up engineers to do what they’re best at while allowing AI to quickly make sense out of messy or even incomplete datasets. It’s designed both for entry-level engineers as well as experienced engineers to help automate time-consuming industrial workflows. We believe AI will be able to expand the global engineering capacity from 30 million to one billion engineers worldwide. It’s going to be a very different and much better world for future generations.”\\nIntuigenceAI’s synthetic engineers integrate directly into industrial workflows through the company’s Intelligent Board platform. It combines both LLM, reasoning and agentic workflows. The platform, known as IntuiAI, can be used as a data assistant but also an interactive AI whiteboard. Engineers upload technical drawings and equipment manuals, while the system automatically pulls in live data from industrial monitoring systems. IntuiAI breaks down complex problems into manageable tasks, assigns analysis to trained IntuigenceAI Chemical or Mechanical AI Engineers, and provides recommendations with clear approval checkpoints for human verification. The “Intuigents” are trained based on expert interviews, proprietary data from the customer and other domain expertise.\\nFor example, IntuigenceAI can automate maintenance planning by gathering equipment specifications, determining material requirements like gaskets and bolts, and filling out detailed isolation planning forms that specify exact technical needs. This efficiency gain allows engineers to focus on higher value activities such as process optimization, yield improvement projects, and strategic troubleshooting that drive real business impact.\\n[IntuigenceAI](https://www.intuigence.ai/)‘s platform integrates with Microsoft Fabric and Microsoft OneLake to deliver industrial AI workload at enterprise scale, enabling Fortune 500 companies to deploy synthetic engineers while leveraging their existing Microsoft investment. The integration connects the IntuiAI platform to industrial data sources through Microsoft OneLake’s secure infrastructure while utilizing multiple AI models, including Azure OpenAI and IntuigenceAI’s own fine-tuned Industrial LLM running on Azure—alongside an industrial knowledge graph on Azure that captures engineering expertise.\\n“Intelligently accessing and processing industrial data is vital for the success of any production-oriented business. By integrating IntuigenceAI’s synthetic AI engineer with the Microsoft Fabric open data platform, we are addressing the critical workforce shortage in industrial sectors. This collaboration empowers thousands of Microsoft Fabric customers to easily transform their industrial operations data into actionable insights, driving innovation and efficiency across the industry,” said Uli Homann, Corporate VP & Distinguished Architect, Microsoft.\\n\\nThe integrated solution also enables IntuigenceAI’s synthetic engineers to join Microsoft Teams calls with field engineers, analyze equipment performance in real-time, and handle complex workflows while leveraging Microsoft Fabric as the secure data backbone.\\nFounded in 2024, IntuigenceAI has 12 employees with team members from Microsoft, Amazon, Meta/Facebook, and the Berkeley AI Research Lab. The company has raised $1M in pre-seed funding from Recursive Ventures and Think Plus. IntuigenceAI creates synthetic engineers specifically for industrial operations, working with Fortune 500 customers including major energy and oil and gas companies in pilot phases.\\nLooking ahead, Tanabian envisions that reaching one billion AI engineers globally will fundamentally transform how humanity tackles its greatest challenges.\\n“A billion synthetic engineers will free up human ingenuity from mundane tasks, allowing us to focus on breakthrough innovations,” he explains. This expanded engineering capacity could accelerate breakthroughs in clean energy production, affordable housing and infrastructure, clean water systems, accessible healthcare technologies, sustainable agriculture systems, educational platforms, disaster preparedness, and even space exploration powered by fusion energy and quantum computing. “We’re not just scaling engineering—we’re scaling human potential to solve problems that matter.”\\nThe IntuigenceAI synthetic AI engineers, which can connect to other systems, join Microsoft Teams calls with field engineers, analyze equipment performance in real-time and handle complex workflows while leveraging Microsoft Fabric as a data store. For instance, when a heat exchanger shows efficiency drops, the Chemical AI Engineer identifies fluid composition changes while the Mechanical AI Engineer reviews inspection and maintenance histories, delivering comprehensive analysis that previously required weeks of coordination between multiple specialists.\\n\\n- [share\\xa0](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Finsidehpc.com%2F2025%2F07%2Fintuigenceai-launches-synthetic-ai-engineers%2F&text=IntuigenceAI%20Launches%20Synthetic%20AI%20Engineers)\\n- [share\\xa0](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finsidehpc.com%2F2025%2F07%2Fintuigenceai-launches-synthetic-ai-engineers%2F)\\n- [share\\xa0\\xa0](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Finsidehpc.com%2F2025%2F07%2Fintuigenceai-launches-synthetic-ai-engineers%2F)\\n- [share\\xa0\\xa0](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Finsidehpc.com%2F2025%2F07%2Fintuigenceai-launches-synthetic-ai-engineers%2F)\\n- [email\\xa0](mailto:?body=https%3A%2F%2Finsidehpc.com%2F2025%2F07%2Fintuigenceai-launches-synthetic-ai-engineers%2F&subject=IntuigenceAI%20Launches%20Synthetic%20AI%20Engineers)\\nFiled Under: [AI News](https://insidehpc.com/category/ai-news/), [Machine Learning](https://insidehpc.com/category/hpc-software/machine-learning/), [News](https://insidehpc.com/category/news-analysis/) Tagged With: [AI](https://insidehpc.com/tag/ai/), [artificial intelligence](https://insidehpc.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/), [IntuiAI](https://insidehpc.com/tag/intuiai/), [IntuigenceAI](https://insidehpc.com/tag/intuigenceai/), [synthetic AI engineers](https://insidehpc.com/tag/synthetic-ai-engineers/)[«](#)[»](#)[»](#)[«](#)\\n\\n#### Sponsored Guest Articles\\n\\n### Re-Engineering Ethernet for AI Fabric\\n\\nEthernet wasn’t built with AI in mind.
