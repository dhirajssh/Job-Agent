## Frequently asked questions

Why does Remote Rocketship cost money?We use powerful scraping tech to scan the internet daily for thousands of remote jobs. It operates 24/7 and costs us to operate, so we charge for access to keep the site running.Can I cancel my subscription anytime?Of course! You can cancel your subscription at any time with no hidden fees or penalties. Once canceled, you’ll still have access until the end of your current billing period.What is the difference between Remote Rocketship and other job boards?Other job boards only have jobs from companies that pay to post. This means that you miss out on jobs from companies that don't want to pay.

      On the other hand, Remote Rocketship scrapes the internet for jobs and doesn't accept payments from companies. This means we have thousands of more jobs!How often are new jobs posted?New jobs are constantly being posted. We check each company website multiple times a day to ensure we have the most up-to-date job listings.Can I suggest jobs to be added?Yes! We're always looking to expand our listings and appreciate any suggestions from our community. Just send an email to Lior@remoterocketship.com.
