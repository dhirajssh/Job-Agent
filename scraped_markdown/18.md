BERKELEY, CA — July 15, 2025 — To address a workforce shortage of engineers while avoiding industrial disasters caused by human error, AI startup IntuigenceAI announced what it calls a superintelligent AI-based engineer, IntuiAI, designed as a multiplier for human engineers.
IntuigenceAI, based out of Berkeley, California, achieved a first-time pass rate of 82% on the standardized NCEES Professional Engineering (PE) exam for both chemical and mechanical engineering, respectively—beating out ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek by more than eight times. IntuigenceAI, which calls its AI agents “Intuigents,” is available at launch as a highly trained chemical or mechanical AI engineer, with several other Intuigents to follow including civil, electrical, industrial and materials engineers. Each Intuigent can work safely alongside human talent to accelerate common industrial workflows.
The company said several Fortune 100 companies are completing successful pilots with the objective of saving millions of dollars by automating tedious workflows across the $3.4 trillion engineering industry. These workflows consume weeks or even months of engineering resources, which IntuigenceAI says can be reduced to days or even minutes, freeing engineers for more complex tasks requiring human intuition.
“As someone who has spent decades in process automation, advanced control and optimization, I see IntuigenceAI as the next generation of industrial technology,” said Doug Raven, a former senior engineer from Saudi Aramco’s Corporate Engineering department and recipient of the top Saudi Aramco Excellence Award. “There’s clearly a workforce shortage coming as experienced engineers retire, and this technology represents a powerful solution for knowledge capture and leveraging engineering expertise. IntuigenceAI can help companies capture their unique methodologies and institutional knowledge while enabling engineers to focus on higher value-added work like process innovation, optimization, and complex problem-solving. The vision of multiplying human engineering capabilities is exactly what the industry needs to address both the skills gap and the complexity of today’s multi-million dollar, multi-year projects.”

According to an analysis by the Coalition to Prevent Chemical Disasters, there is a new chemical accident every two days in the US. Equipment failure and human error can have catastrophic consequences in industrial environments. Infrastructure projects average 28 percent cost overruns with 85% exceeding budget, while workers spend 14+ hours weekly just looking for project data.
“AI has the potential to save millions of dollars and many lives by addressing a serious skills deficit,” said Moe Tanabian, CEO and founder of IntuigenceAI. “While AI has quickly revolutionized software development, using engineering-purpose AI for industrial workflows and data analysis has not been feasible until now.” Tanabian was formerly Global Vice President and executive product leader at Microsoft, Amazon and Samsung. “IntuigenceAI frees up engineers to do what they’re best at while allowing AI to quickly make sense out of messy or even incomplete datasets. It’s designed both for entry-level engineers as well as experienced engineers to help automate time-consuming industrial workflows. We believe AI will be able to expand the global engineering capacity from 30 million to one billion engineers worldwide. It’s going to be a very different and much better world for future generations.”
IntuigenceAI’s synthetic engineers integrate directly into industrial workflows through the company’s Intelligent Board platform. It combines both LLM, reasoning and agentic workflows. The platform, known as IntuiAI, can be used as a data assistant but also an interactive AI whiteboard. Engineers upload technical drawings and equipment manuals, while the system automatically pulls in live data from industrial monitoring systems. IntuiAI breaks down complex problems into manageable tasks, assigns analysis to trained IntuigenceAI Chemical or Mechanical AI Engineers, and provides recommendations with clear approval checkpoints for human verification. The “Intuigents” are trained based on expert interviews, proprietary data from the customer and other domain expertise.
For example, IntuigenceAI can automate maintenance planning by gathering equipment specifications, determining material requirements like gaskets and bolts, and filling out detailed isolation planning forms that specify exact technical needs. This efficiency gain allows engineers to focus on higher value activities such as process optimization, yield improvement projects, and strategic troubleshooting that drive real business impact.
[IntuigenceAI](https://www.intuigence.ai/)‘s platform integrates with Microsoft Fabric and Microsoft OneLake to deliver industrial AI workload at enterprise scale, enabling Fortune 500 companies to deploy synthetic engineers while leveraging their existing Microsoft investment. The integration connects the IntuiAI platform to industrial data sources through Microsoft OneLake’s secure infrastructure while utilizing multiple AI models, including Azure OpenAI and IntuigenceAI’s own fine-tuned Industrial LLM running on Azure—alongside an industrial knowledge graph on Azure that captures engineering expertise.
“Intelligently accessing and processing industrial data is vital for the success of any production-oriented business. By integrating IntuigenceAI’s synthetic AI engineer with the Microsoft Fabric open data platform, we are addressing the critical workforce shortage in industrial sectors. This collaboration empowers thousands of Microsoft Fabric customers to easily transform their industrial operations data into actionable insights, driving innovation and efficiency across the industry,” said Uli Homann, Corporate VP & Distinguished Architect, Microsoft.

The integrated solution also enables IntuigenceAI’s synthetic engineers to join Microsoft Teams calls with field engineers, analyze equipment performance in real-time, and handle complex workflows while leveraging Microsoft Fabric as the secure data backbone.
Founded in 2024, IntuigenceAI has 12 employees with team members from Microsoft, Amazon, Meta/Facebook, and the Berkeley AI Research Lab. The company has raised $1M in pre-seed funding from Recursive Ventures and Think Plus. IntuigenceAI creates synthetic engineers specifically for industrial operations, working with Fortune 500 customers including major energy and oil and gas companies in pilot phases.
Looking ahead, Tanabian envisions that reaching one billion AI engineers globally will fundamentally transform how humanity tackles its greatest challenges.
“A billion synthetic engineers will free up human ingenuity from mundane tasks, allowing us to focus on breakthrough innovations,” he explains. This expanded engineering capacity could accelerate breakthroughs in clean energy production, affordable housing and infrastructure, clean water systems, accessible healthcare technologies, sustainable agriculture systems, educational platforms, disaster preparedness, and even space exploration powered by fusion energy and quantum computing. “We’re not just scaling engineering—we’re scaling human potential to solve problems that matter.”
The IntuigenceAI synthetic AI engineers, which can connect to other systems, join Microsoft Teams calls with field engineers, analyze equipment performance in real-time and handle complex workflows while leveraging Microsoft Fabric as a data store. For instance, when a heat exchanger shows efficiency drops, the Chemical AI Engineer identifies fluid composition changes while the Mechanical AI Engineer reviews inspection and maintenance histories, delivering comprehensive analysis that previously required weeks of coordination between multiple specialists.
