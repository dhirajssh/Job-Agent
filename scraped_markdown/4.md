per yearPosted by Mercor[mercor.com](https://mercor.com)We’re looking for a sharp, ambitious **Software Engineer** to join a high-impact, product-driven team building modern backend systems from the ground up. This role is ideal for a **recent graduate or early-career engineer** who wants to work on real-world infrastructure challenges, ship quickly, and grow alongside experienced technical mentors.
You’ll contribute to core systems that power critical workflows for some of the most advanced AI companies in the world. The ideal candidate combines strong computer science fundamentals with practical project experience and a bias toward building.
This is **not** a rotational training program. From day one, you’ll be expected to write production-grade code, reason about systems end-to-end, and make decisions that directly impact customers. We value people who take ownership, ask great questions, and push for simple solutions to complex problems.
**What you'll do:**

- 
Design and build scalable backend APIs, services, and infrastructure

- 
Work across the stack with product and design to ship new features fast

- 
Write clean, maintainable code and contribute to technical documentation

- 
Participate in code reviews, design discussions, and team retros

- 
Solve real customer problems with real constraints and timelines

**We’re especially interested in candidates who:**

- 
Have completed internships at top-tier tech companies (e.g. Google, Meta, Stripe) or fast-growing startups

- 
Have shipped impressive side projects or contributed to open source

- 
Show strong reasoning skills and the ability to break down ambiguity

- 
Are familiar with modern backend frameworks and cloud platforms

- 
Demonstrate curiosity, grit, and a high technical ceiling

**Technical requirements:**

- 
Proficiency in at least one programming language (Python, Go, Rust, etc.)

- 
Strong understanding of data structures, algorithms, and distributed systems

- 
Familiarity with APIs, databases (SQL/NoSQL), and cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP)
