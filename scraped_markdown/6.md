# AI Developments Point to Further Engineering Job OpportunitiesAI Developments Point to Further Engineering Job Opportunities

Look for positions in AI software engineering, data analysis, machine learning, and building and powering huge data centers, says a recruiting expert.[Daphne Allen](/author/daphne-allen), Editor-in-Chief, Design NewsFebruary 19, 20254 Min ReadSupatman/iStock/Getty Images Plus via Getty ImagesAI developments continue to increase, whether it is Grok 3, [DeepSeek](https://www.designnews.com/electronics/deepseek-splashes-onto-the-tech-market), [The Stargate Project](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/), or any of the numerous niche applications that are emerging. These increasing investments indicate that this field will continue to expand. And that includes ongoing career opportunities.Given all the AI news this year so far, we checked in again with Scott Sargis, founder & president of Strategic Search Corporation, who told us in December that AI skills will be in demand and that careers in “AI, robotics, and IoT will continue to do very well.”“In general, the outlook for engineers and technical personnel will be even rosier than I thought and shared in your [December 2, 2024, article](https://www.designnews.com/industry/what-s-the-2025-outlook-for-engineering-jobs-),” Sargis tells us. “For example, when World Economic Forum January 2025 panel moderator Borge Brende, president and CEO of WEF, asked about the relationship between the US and China over the next four years, [President Trump responded](https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/remarks-by-president-trump-at-the-world-economic-forum/), ‘I think that we are going to have a very good relationship. All we want is fairness. We just want a level playing field.’ This points to greater US prosperity in general and more engineer career opportunities in specific. Not just the engineering opportunities as part of the more than 100,000 projected jobs from the $500 billion Stargate AI project will create, but also for many other new, ancillary engineering jobs.”Related:[The Evolution of AI Through Key Milestones & Breakthroughs](/artificial-intelligence/from-turing-to-gpt-4-the-evolution-of-ai-through-key-milestones-breakthroughs)Sargis believes these jobs will “include AI software engineering positions for those proficient in such programming languages like [Python](https://www.designnews.com/electronics/using-python-to-program-raspberry-pi-5-for-iot-devices-sensors-robotics), [ChatGPT](https://www.designnews.com/artificial-intelligence/putting-chatgpt-4-0-through-its-paces), C++ and Java. However, this will also include a diverse array of other engineering jobs including data analysis, machine learning, plant and project engineers (for construction of the huge data centers), and energy-related engineering positions (especially since these huge AI data centers will require vast amounts of new energy).”It is also important to note that billions of dollars of venture capital are flowing to AI startups, according to [Crunchbase data](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/startups-ai-seed-investors-data-charts-ye-2024/?utm_source=cb_daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=20230703), potentially offering a range of opportunities.## AI newsmakers

Even though The Stargate project initially included technology partners Arm, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, and OpenAI, engineers shouldn’t take their eyes off Elon Musk and his technology plans. Musk's xAI just released [Grok 3](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/musks-xai-unveils-grok-3-ai-chatbot-rival-chatgpt-chinas-deepseek-2025-02-18/), for instance."As I shared in your December 2, 2024, article, ‘Follow the Musk.’" Sargis says. "Musk carries enormous weight in this administration not only for DOGE, which offers continuous improvement and cost cutting, but also with futuristic technical achievements," Sargis says.Related:[Stop Scaling Blind: How Engineers Can Prevent DevOps & AI Startups from Burning Cash on Growth](/artificial-intelligence/stop-scaling-blind-how-engineers-can-prevent-devops-ai-startups-from-burning-cash-on-growth)For instance, "to demonstrate the depth and breadth of how adept the DOGE 'Wiz Kids' are at applying AI to assist with their herculean cost-cutting tasks," Sargis points to one DOGE engineer, Luke Farritor, who once used "auto segmentation algorithms" to "[virtually unroll a fragile Herculaneum scroll without physically cracking its carbonized layers](https://www.rdworldonline.com/how-a-doge-engineer-and-former-spacex-intern-used-ai-to-decode-some-of-historys-oldest-sealed-scrolls/)," according to R&D World. Says Sargis: "Luke’s past accomplishment points to the unique knowledge and applications of AI that Musk’s DOGE team is applying." ## How can you tap into AI for success?

Sargis advises engineers to “pursue AI prowess in a non-conventional manner. Growing fields such as AI are changing so quickly that formal classes or degrees will often have a one-year lag time for relevancy. This means that by the time the curriculum for the class or degree becomes institutionalized, that class or degree will no longer be as relevant. Instead, engineers should consider joining associations, symposiums, lectures, work groups, and online learning to acquire needed cutting-edge skills, as they will be a more robust way to learn develop AI knowledge.”Sargis also advises job seekers to develop their interviewing skills. He says his recruiting team “regularly complains that young engineers, scientists, and technology professionals lack strong interview skills. That is why my firm developed the 'Real Benefit Exercise' for our engineering candidates. We studied top salespeople to see what they were doing right in closing their deals. Then we isolated those behaviors that were easiest to replicate by our engineers during job interviews. We found that the best ones spoke in terms of benefits to the customer. In this case you should view your interviewer as your customer and what you have to offer is a solution to their needs.
